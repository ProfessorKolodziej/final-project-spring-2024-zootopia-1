          <p>Penguins are highly social animals, often seen engaging in various activities within their colonies.They communicate with each other through vocalizations, body language, and displays.

        <section class="info-section"> <h3 class="sub-heading">Behavior</h3>
          <p>They eat fish, tiny shrimp-like creatures called krill, and sometimes squid. 
            They zoom and dive through the water, grabbing their meals with their sharp beaks. 
            Each type of penguin has its own favorite food, depending on where they live. Eating these sea foods helps penguins stay strong and warm in their cold homes.</p >
