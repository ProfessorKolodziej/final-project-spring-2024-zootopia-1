            Dairy cows typically live in spacious pastures and farms. Pastures provide dairy cows with ample grassland and a comfortable environment to ensure they remain healthy and vibrant. In the pasture, dairy cows often form close bonds with other cows and farmers.</p >

        <section class="info-section"> <h3 class="sub-heading">Dietary Habits</h3>
