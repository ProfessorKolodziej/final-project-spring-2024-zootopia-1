        <section class="info-section"> <h3 class="sub-heading">Appearance and Characteristics</h3>
          <p>Large eyes and flat faces--- see better at night. 
            Eyes are forward-facing---perceive depth and see in three dimensions, just like humans.
            Flexible necks( rotating nearly 360 degrees) ---  observe surroundings without moving their bodies.</p >

          <p>Carnivorous birds.: insects, mice, and other small animals. Fly silently, making almost no sound;
            and then swoop down suddenly to catch their prey.
        </p >
