          <p>
            Seabirds, including species like the albatross, puffin, and seagull, traverse the open seas, often nesting on secluded coastal cliffs and islands. They are found across the world's oceans, from the Arctic to the Antarctic, making their homes where land meets water.

        <section class="info-section"> <h3 class="sub-heading">Appearance and Characteristics</h3>
          <p>Streamlined bodies and long wings, seabirds are built for life on the wing. 
            They boast waterproof feathers, varying from the bright beaks of puffins to the stark white of gulls. 
            These birds have salt-excreting glands and webbed feet, perfect for their saline and aerial lives.</p >

        <section class="info-section"> <h3 class="sub-heading">Dietary Habits</h3>
          <p>Masters of the sky and sea, seabirds predominantly feed on marine life. Their diet includes fish, squid, and crustaceans, which they skillfully catch with precision beaks and diving prowess, playing an essential role in the oceanic food chain.</p >
